    When it was time to design the museum, I went back to the original question: what is hip-hop to me? As a person from China (where hip-hop culture is nearly nonexistent), hip-hop is a form of expression that is very foreign to me.<br><br>

    My design process went through three main phases, which guided my approach to creating the hip-hop museum. In the beginning, I spent lots of time rationalizing hip-hop and breaking it down into material that was digestible. My time was invested into researching what makes hip-hop “hiphop”.
    <br><br>
    I learned that there are four pillars of hip-hop: the DJ, the MC, Break Dancing, and Graffiti art. If each of the pillars were represented in a program of space, it would be DJ for the music lab/workshop, MC for the performance space, break dancing for the theatre, and graffiti art for the galleries. However the pillars and programs are not independent; they intersect. To me, the core of everything that hip-hop is there is a library that serves as a unifying body combining all aspects of the pillars and uniting them.

    <br>
    I titled the second phase of my design “diction disjunction”. Initially I was having issues with diction analysis, particularly when the rhyme scheme is not linear or regular. I don't recognize rhyme schemes very readily so instead I focus on rhythm and beats. This made diagramming songs a very tedious process.
    <br><br>
    In the building design, there is a void space representing this disjunction, breaking through every program with the stairs going around, in and out. The stairways carry energy out of the building. The disjunction creates a fascinating view inside for the visitors to experience. The open space allows them to stand on any floor and readily look up into the sky.

    <br>
    I titled the final phase of my design “atmospheric space”. In the phase, I looked to directly translate the emotion and expression of Hip Hop culture into architecture.
    <br>
    In the rendered section, we don't see people doing different activities but ourselves. The space, like a song, is atmospheric, and sometimes we feel lost or even overwhelmed because of the fullness of emotions.
    <br><br>
    This approach also leads me to treat space differently to evoke spatial and emotional qualities. The gallery space is horizontal with the mobile panels acting as the graffiti trains on train rails. They come, stay, and leave. The library on the other hand, is vertical with dropping records on the ceiling. It expands through three floors and connects all the programs in the building. All the space together serves as a liquid collage (the image on the first page of the project), with the building becoming the container.
