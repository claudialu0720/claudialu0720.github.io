    As someone from China, where hip-hop culture is not part of everyday life, I approach this project by asking a foundational question: What is hip-hop to me? Rather than an inherited cultural identity, hip-hop appears as an expressive form that is unfamiliar—yet its rhythm, intensity, and spatial potential deeply intrigue me. This question leads me into a three-phase design process, where research, translation, and emotional resonance transform into architectural form.<br><br>

    Phase I – Rationalizing the Culture
    <br>
    The four pillars of hip-hop—DJ, MC, breakdancing, and graffiti—provide a framework for the museum’s spatial program. I assign each to a dedicated space: DJ to a music lab, MC to a performance venue, breakdancing to a theatre, and graffiti to a gallery. These elements are not isolated; they intersect and overlap. At their core is a central library that unifies the programs vertically and symbolically, acting as the heart of the building.

    Phase II – Diction Disjunction
    <br>
    While analyzing rhyme structures, I realize that linear and rational methods often fall short. Rhymes in hip-hop are irregular, fragmentary, and sometimes intangible. I shift my method toward a more intuitive and deconstructive approach—locating major rhymes, marking them with circles, and tracing visual connections. These lines suggest rhythm rather than structure, generating a new spatial logic.
    <br><br>
    I translate this concept architecturally through a vertical void that cuts through the entire building. It contains staircases that zigzag in and out of different programs. The void acts as a physical manifestation of disjunction—visitors experience rupture, rhythm, and vertical energy. From any level, they can look upward toward the sky or observe others in motion, just like in a constantly shifting beat.

    <br>
    Phase III – Atmospheric Space
    <br>
    In the final phase, I focus on capturing the emotional resonance of hip-hop. The building becomes a space where rhythm, density, and emotion find spatial expression. In sectional renderings, visitors do not appear as static users but as part of a larger atmosphere—immersed in light, scale, and sound.
    <br><br>
    The gallery space extends horizontally, with mobile display panels functioning like graffiti-covered train cars that arrive, stay, and depart. The library rises vertically, its ceiling populated by hanging records, forming a loose canopy of memory and sound. These contrasting directions create a layered spatial composition. Together, the building becomes a fluid collage of emotional space—unified by movement and intensity.
