    The diagram (on the left) is a visual representation of a hip-hop song named “Freedom” by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. It is one of the earliest party songs in 1980s. I analyzed the song chronologically: the x-axis is time; the y-axis is emotion/ atmosphere. It shows at a party, where as time goes by, people's emotions go higher and higher.

    The three found-object models (on the right) translate observations of poetic elements from a hip-hop song named “Freedom” by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. It is one of the earliest party songs in 1980s. The models are made from computer parts, wood, and glass.

    The plan and section drawings of found-object models defined the basis for the expression of graphic language.

    The “children drawings” led a particular zigzag characteristic that continues in the Relief Model. Shapes generated from the “children drawings” are put in Rhino and thenlofted, booleaned, and recombined.
