    <br>
    To design a climate research center that constantly collects and uses large amount of data from the city, the plug-in “Crow” based on the logic of Self- Organizing Map (SOM) helps with sifting inputs and re-organizing the program on the site. The original program arrangement based on the site analysis was to have two wings—education and research – spinning around the two peaks. The south facing hill is perfect for planting and researching on green walls/ roofs. The north facing hill is well shaded for educational space.

    <br>
    After putting the major programs as boxes on the site, Self-Organizing Map draws connections among the boxes and jitters out a more integrated layout. The education and research space alternates and defines “permeable” and “impermeable” of the entire architecture.

    Modular Units: Weaire Phelan structure

    <br>
    The “Weaire-Phelan” structure, a complex 3-dimensional module based structure representing an idealized foam of equalsized bubbles, gives an idea adaptability to the building so it changes to reflect the data collected from the city. The change is live and seasonal.

    The flexibility of the module also allows us to move them around in order to create space in various scales for specific activities.
