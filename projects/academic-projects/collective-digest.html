    The Site
    <br>
    Ciutat Vella, the historic nucleus of Barcelona, comprises four large districts (Gothic Quater, El Born, Barceloneta, and El Raval). The urban fabric of Ciutat Vella is irregular and random since it has accumulated the traces of the last 2,000 years of history, from Roman Barcino, the Barchinona of the Middle Ages, to the multicultural and cutting-edge Barcelona of the 21st century.

    The Issue
    <br>
    El Raval is one of Barcelona's most vibrant and complex neighborhoods, shaped by its diverse immigrant communities, heavy tourist traffic, and a persistent reputation for petty crime. These contrasting elements—cultural richness, bustling crowds, and a gritty edge—combine to give El Raval its distinct and dynamic character.

    Rambla del Raval (an urban renewal project)<br>
    In 1995, the plan for the Raval Rambla was presented, with the aim of socially
    cleansing southern El Raval. Five complete street blocks were affected and the
    scheme involved the demolition of 1,384 houses and 293 commercial premises.
    The tree-lined pedestrianised zone thus created measures 58 meters in width and
    317 meters in length.
    <br><br>
    What was built during the urban renewal was a five-star luxury hotel named Hotel
    Barceló Raval. The rest of the site remained empty for increasing better traffic and
    circulation. However, due to the large scale and vacancy, Rambla del Raval has become
    one of the most dangerous areas in Barcelona.

    <br>
    I titled the second phase of my design “diction disjunction”. Initially I was having issues with diction analysis, particularly when the rhyme scheme is not linear or regular. I don't recognize rhyme schemes very readily so instead I focus on rhythm and beats. This made diagramming songs a very tedious process.
    <br><br>
    In the building design, there is a void space representing this disjunction, breaking through every program with the stairs going around, in and out. The stairways carry energy out of the building. The disjunction creates a fascinating view inside for the visitors to experience. The open space allows them to stand on any floor and readily look up into the sky.

    The Chimney
    <br>
    With hot air and smoke accumulated from the bottom to the top, the chimney hosts all the hot cooking activities in the building. The openings on the sides release the smell of food, which becomes a guide to draw people into space.
