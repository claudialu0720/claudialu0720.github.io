                    In the Integrative Design Practices Studio, thermally logical site design, multivalent performance of roof structures, innovative enclosures and tectonic assemblies are investigated altogether. The vehicle for these investigations is a new Arts based co-working facility in Bushwick, Brooklyn.
                    <br><br>
                    In this design project, the concept of alternating transparency between visual and physical is captured by the structural frames acting also as the cinematic episodes through the public space.

    My approach to Arts Collective is to break the boundary between the artist region and the public realm by alternating the level of visual and physical transparency.
    <br><br>
    The sectional shifts open up each program and allow more visual access in the facility. While longitudinally, the “public promenade“ - a guided circulation - connects each sectional moment and lead the public through the space.
    <br>

    I titled the second phase of my design “diction disjunction”. Initially I was having issues with diction analysis, particularly when the rhyme scheme is not linear or regular. I don't recognize rhyme schemes very readily so instead I focus on rhythm and beats. This made diagramming songs a very tedious process.
    <br><br>
    In the building design, there is a void space representing this disjunction, breaking through every program with the stairs going around, in and out. The stairways carry energy out of the building. The disjunction creates a fascinating view inside for the visitors to experience. The open space allows them to stand on any floor and readily look up into the sky.
