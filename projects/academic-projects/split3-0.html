    Inspired by contemporary shared housing concepts, the housing design has flexible sleeping arrangements enabled by sliding wall panels.
    <br><br>
    The built-in furniture on the periphery of the building not only maximizes the flexibility of the interior space, but also acts as a passive design system that shades the summer sun with its particular orientation.
    <br><br>
    Each floor's communal space is located at the triangular area that is defined by the service elements, including stairs, bathrooms, kitchens, and load-bearing walls.

    The general public interacts with the residents at the ground level, where the ramps, cat yard, and landscape function as connecting paths for the major academic buildings on campus.

    The level of privacy increases as the floor goes up. With human occupants moving in and out seasonally, the cats as permanent residents of the housing units receive care and affection.

    Actively free roaming in the house, on the site, and all over the city, the cats are the urban agency that draws us together at architectural places.
