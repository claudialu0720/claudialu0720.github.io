                    The intent of the Aquatic Center design was to explore in what ways architecture can be communicated, conceived, understood, and presented as a narrative, utilizing architecture and film to produce a dialogue among people, time, and space.                </p>

    Through film and material exploration of the site, I aimed to explore the concept of the changing stages of water in my design.  The journey to the site is expressed through the temporal quality of still shots.
    <br><br>
    The experience of an individual as they move through space is choreographed to illustrate the change of water’s dynamics and temperature, with an emphasis on overlapped space representing the transition of water between different states.

    My design process went through three main phases, which guided my approach to creating the hip-hop museum. In the beginning, I spent lots of time rationalizing hip-hop and breaking it down into material that was digestible. My time was invested into researching what makes hip-hop “hiphop”.
    <br><br>
    I learned that there are four pillars of hip-hop: the DJ, the MC, Break Dancing, and Graffiti art. If each of the pillars were represented in a program of space, it would be DJ for the music lab/workshop, MC for the performance space, break dancing for the theatre, and graffiti art for the galleries. However the pillars and programs are not independent; they intersect. To me, the core of everything that hip-hop is there is a library that serves as a unifying body combining all aspects of the pillars and uniting them.
