            In this diction analysis, I chronologically diagrammed the sections and breaks of the song through analysis of rhyme scheme. 
            The black bars are used to indicate the relationship between the rhymes and time. Arrows stand for an echo effect. 
            Almost every small section has four lines, which connect to other lines with the same rhyme scheme or alliteration with curved dotted lines on the top and straight lines on the bottom.

            When I listened to this song for the first time, I pictured the song as a creature growing bigger and bigger as the MCs repeat “Number one, one, one, one, one…” I used as spiral figure to illustrate the growing motion. Starting from the center, the main line grows rhymes and sub-rhymes on the branches as it stretches to make thresholds when the refrain comes.

            When I analyzed this song’s diction, I realized that being rational (i.e. being chronological and marking the elements of the song) is not enough for analyzing all hip-hop songs. The rhymes are so fragmentary and vague that it is impossible to label and mark every single detail of the song. I started with locating some major rhymes indicated through the use of circles on top of the diagram. Connecting them with lines and extending the lines down to create the paths of the track. This is a de-constructing process.
